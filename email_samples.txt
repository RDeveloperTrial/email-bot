Sent from my iPhoneHello Prof. Melton,

I apologize for missing the deadline for the reflection journal on Bartleby; I was in the habit of doing the journal entry after the second class period, so I was caught off guard and forgot to complete the assignment before 6pm. I attached a pdf of my response below because the NYU classes page does not allow late submissions.

Thanks,

Sent from my iPhoneHi,

My name is Ian Samir and my student number is N13654284. I just came back
from vacation and am having some trouble registering for classes for this
fall. I will be a freshman at NYU this year. I would like to take an Econ
class and a finance class at Stern and a math course. However, the class
enrollment tool keeps telling me I do not have the prerequisites for any
courses I pick. I am not sure if I have to take placement tests or
something but I cannot enroll in any classes at this time and would very
much appreciate some help.

Thanks,

Ian

 After Quiz 3 and dinner, we basically have free time. I think it’s at this
point I was talking with some people about harmonic stuff, and I end up
teaching projective transformations to a small crowd of students. Lots of
fun, and suddenly I become a lot more popular as people realize I actually
know some math.

Hi Mr. Steele,

Sorry to email this late but I was trying to submit my chapter 5 project
from around 11 pm and it would not accept my file or render it properly at
all. I apologize for not trying/asking earlier but I got home around 10ish
from school activities and still had to do some calculations for #5-7 on
the sheet and finished around 11. I tried submitting via PDF and converting
it to different document endings but my computer does not have windows
office licensing so I think that caused more problems. I tried to use latex
to make it look nicer but I think that caused the file problems. By the
time my file finished converting to a doc the project was locked and I
could not try any more ways to submit it. I hope you'll understand, I've
attatched the PDF to this email.

Thanks,

Ian G1

Karas best friend asked her at lunch if she liked me and she said what I
sent u earlier. But "ok, so I was on my way to my locker and hse was all
alone so I went up too her and was like "hey Kara, and She was not herself
at all and kinda just said "hey" in a really awk way and we kinda just
talked but it was awk as hell. And then she said I have to go this way and
she went down the stairs and I went down other stairs and it was so awful.
She literally ran into me in the hallway so we kinda started talking again
and it was once again awk as hell. She didn't smile or even look at me (she
always does) and then I sorta asked her and then she quickly sped up and
found a diff friend. It's whatever
asdf
Okay so once your comfortable you can ask her for her number some time so u
can have someone to ask fo rhelp and stuff Lik that. Then u make a group
chat for your friends in APUSH and include me. Lik all of your close
friends in that class then me & Kara. Then we can all text and she will get
an idea who I am. From there I can text her cuz I'll have her number and
add her on snap. Then if I get to know her for even Lik a day or two I can
then say hi to her in hallway and stuff Lik that and then potentially later
on this quarter to Maybe even next quarter (whenever you're ready) you can
Hav me u & her And maybe some other people over to study then from there I
can talk to her more and have a good convo with her and then I'll try my
best to get to know her really well and then make a move! And then I'll
thank you until the end of time.

Ian Hi Mrs. Kundrat,

I'd like to retake the buffers Ch 15-16 Test on May 12th. I didn't have
late work that unit, and I was wondering if we could complete the steps on
canvas for the pre-retake assignment or if there is an official sheet that
we must complete (for the extra practice problems and reasoning etc. )

Very sorry I forgot to hand in my summary of the movie 13th before the
